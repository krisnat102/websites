            <h2>Tokyo Tower</h2>
            <p>Tokyo Tower is a communications and observation tower in Minato, Tokyo, Japan. Completed in 1958, it stands at 333 meters (1,092 feet) and was inspired by the Eiffel Tower. Painted in white and international orange for aviation safety, it serves as both a broadcasting tower and a tourist attraction. The tower has two observation decks that offer panoramic views of Tokyo, and on clear days, visitors can see Mount Fuji in the distance. At its base is Foot Town, a multi-story building with museums, shops, and restaurants. Tokyo Tower remains a symbol of Japan’s post-war rebirth and modernization.</p>

            <h2>Shirahige Bridge</h2>
            <p>Shirahige Bridge is a steel arch bridge spanning the Sumida River in Tokyo, Japan. Completed in 1931, it connects the Mukojima and Shirahige neighborhoods. The bridge features a distinctive curved design and blue coloration, making it a recognizable landmark along the river. It was built as part of Tokyo’s modernization efforts in the early 20th century and remains an important transportation route. At night, the bridge is illuminated, offering a scenic view along the Sumida River, especially during events like the Sumida River Fireworks Festival. Shirahige Bridge is both a functional infrastructure piece and a symbol of Tokyo’s urban development.</p>
